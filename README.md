# ECE7123 Mini Project 2

 ResNet with early exit can acheive higher accuracy and reduce computational cost. In this experiment we compare the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 classification accuracy of baseline models (ResNet20, ResNet32, ResNet56, ResNet110) to early exit models to show the benefits of early exit.

```baseline``` folder contains baseline model training. ```early-exit``` folder contains early exit model training.
